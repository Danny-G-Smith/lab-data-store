# Data Store Lab

The starter kit for the Data Store hands-on coding lab series on Know the Code.  

## What is a data store?

A data store provides you with a centralized, globally available, and persistent way to store values (data and state) and configuration parameters.

## 3 Different Architectures

In this lab series and plugin, you'll build the data store in 3 different ways:

- Procedural - all function based
- Static Class - procedural wrapped inside of a class and using static methods and properties
- OOP - as an object
